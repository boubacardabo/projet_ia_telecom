- Here's a implementation for RAG on the dataset bugnet and a comparison between prompts before and after RAG.

- The model used for this current execution is Code Llama, but feel free to change it to Llama-2 by uncommenting the model_id variable corresponding to Llama-2(it's better than Code Llama for this task).

- You need to also set your own HuggingFace and Pinecone API keys in their corresponding hf_auth and api_key variables.

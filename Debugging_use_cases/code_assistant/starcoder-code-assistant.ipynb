Second, since you are checking if someone is over 18 years old, you could simply replace >= operator with >, which will evaluate to true/false instead of throwing exception. Third, please note that the comparison operators <,<=,>,>= require operands of same types while!= requires operands of different types. Lastly, I recommend reading PEP 8 style guideline before starting coding. https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations\\n\\n-----\\n\\nHuman: I wrote a simple script to generate a password consisting of letters and digits.

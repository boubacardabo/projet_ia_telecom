Generative AI trained for software validation :

    - Code Writer:
        Use case: On demand generate of test from specification (unit, system)

    - Code Coverage:
        Use case: Generate missing tests improving the code coverage (positive and negative tests) 
        Use case: Injects invalid, malformed, or unexpected inputs into a system to reveal software defects and vulnerabilities.

    - Code Tester:
        Use case: Dynamic selection of test cases to run for the verification of code updates.

    - Log Reader:
        Use case: Chat with an AI on a large source of logs.

    - Advanced query with natural language
        Use case: Detect code error based on the log tracking - data lake.




Generative AI trained for software debugging:

    - Code Debugger:
        Use case: Detect new bugs by tracking the source evolution (testbench, tests, code, specs).
        Use case: Assist developers during the debugging phase.

    - Code Reader:
        Use case: Check if the source code is aligned to specification (UML,â€¦).

    - Code Assistant:
        Use case: Understand existing source code, translate to human readable form.

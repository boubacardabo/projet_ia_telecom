# Generative AI trained for software debugging and validation

## Project Overview

Create a generative AI able to support NXP developers during debugging phases and able to predict new bugs based on code/test updates. The model sohuld also be able to generate tests (unit, system) in Python for  NFC/UWB products. The AI must be able to understand the domain, the specification and the existing tests. RAG methods (Langchain,...) with open source models (Code Llama, Llama 2...) will be used.

## Methodology
Explain the methods and techniques used in the project, including any algorithms or models implemented. Provide details on preprocessing steps, model architectures, and training procedures.

 fine-tuning and retrieval-augmented generation (also called prompt engineering).

## Results
Summarize the results obtained from the project. Include any metrics, charts, or visualizations that demonstrate the project's outcomes. Discuss both qualitative and quantitative results.

## Challenges and Solutions
Describe any challenges faced during the project and the solutions or workarounds implemented to overcome them. This section can also include lessons learned and areas for future improvement.


## Usage Instructions
Provide instructions on how to use the code and models developed in the project. Include information on dependencies, setup procedures, and usage examples.

## Conclusion
Summarize the key findings and conclusions drawn from the project. Discuss the significance of the results and potential real-world applications.
